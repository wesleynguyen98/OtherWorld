Welcome to **OtherWorld**, an immersive Coraline-themed web application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**. This project is a visual and interactive homage to the “Other World” featured in *Coraline*, blending animation, responsive design, and Firebase-backed user interactions to create a storybook-inspired portal you can actually walk through.
